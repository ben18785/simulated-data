# simulated-data
In this course, we will use simulation based analyses to investigate a range of statistical issues.

In the problem sets, we cover the following:

- [time series regression](problem_notebooks/time_series_regression.ipynb): In this example, we generate time series to illustrate how to perform a simulation-based analysis to determine the risk of false positives in regression. This example also illustrates some of the surprising pitfalls of doing regression analyses of time series data.
- [interaction effects](problem_notebooks/interaction_effects_power_analysis.ipynb): In this example, we perform a simulation analysis of a regression model and use it to determine the power to detect so-called "main" and "interaction" effects.
- [identifiability](problem_notebooks/identifiability.ipynb): In this example, we investigate the identifiability of a simple model of tumour growth using simulated data.
